🔍 LangChain Models Playground — Unlocking Language Intelligence

Welcome to the LangChain Models Playground — a curated collection of intelligent language workflows powered by LangChain and OpenAI! This project is built for developers, learners, and tinkerers who want to explore how language models understand, search, and reason with natural language.

> ✨ Whether you're working with raw prompts, chat models, or advanced embeddings — this repo brings it all together under one roof.

🧠 Highlight: Document Similarity with OpenAI Embeddings

In the 4_document_similarity.py script, we:

Use text-embedding-3-large to embed famous Indian cricketers' bios

Accept a natural language query like “Tell me about Bumrah”

Calculate semantic similarity using cosine_similarity

Retrieve the most relevant text match


> 🧪 This shows how AI can truly understand and compare meaning, not just keywords.
